# Stacks Chain Status

This is a simple node.js app that checks the status of the Stacks blockchain testnet. It also sends out a series of transactions including token transfer, contract deploy and contract function call transactions as part of the status check. The main page is served by express.js and data storage is handled by Redis.

To start:

`npm install && npm run dev`
